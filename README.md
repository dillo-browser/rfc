# Dillo RFC documents

This repository contains Dillo RFC documents that describe large changes or
features that require some thought.

For now we only define two states for each document:

- Draft: Still in development.
- Ratified: The final version.

For now let's use Markdown, which is easy to write and keep under source
control.
